March 3, 2010

Version 2.0.0-RC4 released. Changes:
 - fixed issue with invalid data being returned in the afterBack callback when the history plugin is enabled.
 - fixed so that the afterNext and afterBack trigger correctly when the history plugin is used
 - added an option to show the back button on the first step. The option is named showBackOnFirstStep and defaults to false - thus hiding the backbutton on the first step.

-----------------------

February 11, 2010

Version 2.0.0-RC3 released. Changes: 
 - fixed "vertical jumping" of the page after wizard initialization and when navigating between steps. This occurred due to the browser url having a hash (#stepid) that equaled an element id in the page. The fix was to append a '_'-character before the step id when using the history plugin. This means of course that people using direct linking to a step need to revise their url:s by prepending the same '_'-character. One can also use the show method of the plugin to get to a specified step e.g. $('#idofelement').click(function(){$("#formid").formwizard("show","stepid");});

February 10, 2010

Version 2.0.0-RC2 released. Changes: 
 - fixed bug where radiobuttons did not work as links.
 - fixed so that first input field of each step can be focused properly by setting focusFirstInput to true
 - fixed smoother animation when transitioning between steps (only available when history plugin is disabled).
 - added option for specifying outAnimation. (e.g. fadeOut, slideUp and hide, most visible when having the history plugin disabled)

-----------------------

February 4, 2010

Version 2.0.0-RC released. Changes: The internal structure of the plugin has been restructured for easier maintainability and extension.

 - Input fields need not be disabled in the HTML anymore, done by the plugin during initialization. If the form is big one can still disable the inputs in HTML and set the option <b>disableInputFields</b> to false in the wizard settings.
 - The navigation of the plugin is now based on id:s of the steps, which in turn means that all elements that define a step <b>must have a unique id</b>.
 - It is now possible to have the wizard focusing the first input field on each step during navigation. This can be enabled by setting the opiton <b>focusFirstInput</b> to true.
 - One can now specify the transition animation between the steps. The option enabling this are <b>inAnimation</b>
 - The animation of this version should be smoother and the navigation buttons are disabled during the transition.
 - The submit steps are specified by adding a class <b>submit_step</b> to the <b>step element</b> instead of a hidden link on the step.
 - A method <b>destroy</b> has been added to completely remove the wizard functionality from a form.
 - A method <b>show</b> has been added to provide functionality to show any step in the wizard. (Should probably be used with care.)
 - A method <b>state</b> has been added to provide a means to get the state of the wizard.
 - The documentation has been updated to be more concise and hopefully the wizard will be easier to use as a result of that.
 - The documentation is available at http://thecodemine/
